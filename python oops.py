# class and object 

# class is the instance of the object.

# object is the template of the class.

# for e.g.,

"""
	
	if class is a blueprint of home designing , we can do that blue print with anything , we can make many houses.. here houses are considred as object.
	
	
for e.g.,

	SUPER MARIO GAME
	
here many enemies are there 
turtle
chain comp
boo
goomba
dragon
		here these enemies have unique power of attacking ...
		that are size , postion , effective , power , dead === these are controls by class
		and , the differenet enemies are mad up by this things is called object...

# encapsulation () 

"""

	encapsulation
*  class with data we can write in same class
*  hiding data . prevent direct access from outside
 access through methods
 
* getter 			     * setter 
* retrieve infromation	 * modifier infromation

"""

# abstraction ()

"""

* only show essential detail

* hide all other details

* interface							* implementation
* shown outside details (class)		* hidden from outside details (class)

"""

# inheritance ()

"""
* allow classes to use .. data & method from another class	

* hierarchy .

				* super class
			/			|			\
		   /			|			 \
	* class 1 		* class 2 	* class 3	


		sub class inherit from super class


* access modifiers
public , private , protected

"""

# polymorphism ()

"""

* ability of methods to take more than one form

2 types

* dynamic
* static




# dynamic ()

occurs during run time

if both super class and sub class have same method means ..., here they use polymorphism





# static ()

occurs during compile - time

function or method overloading

same class with same function we write , but different argument ...
