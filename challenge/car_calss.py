# Class of Cars
# b.	Create three classes of three car brands â€“ Ford, BMW, and Tesla. The attributes of the car's objects will be, model, color, year, transmission, and whether the car is electric or not (Boolean value.) Consider using inheritance in your answer.
# You will create one object for each car brand:

# bmw1 : model: x6, Color: silver, Year: 2018, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False tesla1: model: S, Color: beige, Year: 2017, Transmission: Auto, Electric: True ford1 : model: focus, Color: white, Year: 2020, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False

# You will create a class method, called print_cars that will be able to print out objects of the class. For example, if you call the method on the ford1 object of the Ford class, your function should be able to print out car info in this exact format: car_model = focus
# Color = White Year = 2020
# Transmission = Auto Electric = False


class Cars:
    def __init__(self, model, color, year, transmission, electric=False):
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.year = year
        self.transmission = transmission
        self.electric = electric

# Creating the class method
    def print_car(self):
        return f'car_model = {self.model}\nColor = ' \
            f'{self.color} \nYear = {self.year}' \
            f' \nTransmission = {self.transmission} ' \
            f'\nElectric = {self.electric}'


class BMW(Cars):
    def __ini__(self, model, color, year, transmission, electric=False):
        Cars.__init__(self, model, color, year,
                      transmission, electric=electric)


class Tesla(Cars):
    def __init__(self, model, color, year, transmission, electric=False):
        Cars.__init__(self, model, color, year,
                      transmission, electric=electric)


class Ford(Cars):
    def __init__(self, model, color, year, transmission, electric=False):
        Cars.__init__(self, model, color, year,
                      transmission, electric=electric)


# instantiating class objects
ford1 = Ford("Focus", "White", 2017, "Auto", False)
print(ford1.print_car())
tesla1 = Tesla("S", "Grey", 2016, "Manual", True)
print(tesla1.print_car())
bmw1 = BMW('X6', 'silver', 2018, 'Auto', False)
print(bmw1.print_car())


# Class of Cars
# In this challenge, we create the Cars class. This class is the parent class to class of car brands. This is called inheritance. The child classes are inheriting the properties and methods of the parent class. The child classes have Cars as an argument.
