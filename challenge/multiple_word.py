# Multiply Words
# s = "love live and laugh"
# Write a function called multiply_words that takes a string as an argument and 
# multiplies the length of each word in the string by the length of other words in
# the string. For example, the string above should return 240 - 
# love (4) live (4) and (3) laugh (5). However, your function should only
# multiply words will all lowercase letters. If a word has one upper case letter, 
# it should be ignored. For example, the following string:
# s = "Hate war love Peace" should return 12 â€“ war (3) love (4). Hate and 
# Peace will be ignored because they have at least one uppercase letter.


import math


def multiply_words(s: str): 
    arr = []
    for word in s.split(): 
        if word.islower():
            arr.append(len(word))
# Using the math prod to multiply the lengths 
        m = math.prod(arr)
    return 'The prod of the word lengths is', m


# strings
str2 = "love live and laugh" 
str3 = "Hate war love Peace"


print(multiply_words(str2))
print(multiply_words(str3))

# In this challenge, we create a list of the length of all the words in the string. 
# We then multiply the lengths using the prod from the math module.
