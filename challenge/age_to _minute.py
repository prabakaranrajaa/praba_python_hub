# Your Age in Minutes
# Write a function called age_in_minutes that tells a user how old they are in minutes. 
# Your code should ask the user to enter their year of birth, and it should return their age in minutes 
# (by subtracting their year of birth to the current year). Here are things to look out for:
# a.	The user can only input a 4-digit year of birth. For example, 1930 is a valid year. However, entering any 
# number longer or less than 4 digits long should render input invalid. Notify the user to input a four digits number.
# b.		If a user enters a year before 1900, your code should tell the user that input is invalid. 
# If the user enters the year after the current year, the code should tell the user, to input a valid year.
# The code should run until the user inputs a valid year. Your function should return the user's age in minutes. 
# For example, if someone enters 1930, as their year of birth your function should return:
# You are 48,355,200 minutes old.

def your_age(): 
    while True:
        birth_year = input('Enter your year of birth: ') 
        if len(birth_year) != 4:
            print('Please enter a four digits year')
        elif int(birth_year) < 1900 or int(birth_year) > 2022: 
            print('Please enter a valid year')
        else:
        # This returns the current year
            now1 = int(datetime.now().strftime("%Y")) 
            age = (now1 - int(birth_year)) * 525600 
        return f'You are {age:,} minutes old.'


print(your_age())



# Your Age in Minutes Remember to import the datetime module for this challenge. 
# You will need to use the while loop to keep the code running until a valid year is inputted.
