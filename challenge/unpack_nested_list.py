# Write a code that generates a list of the following numbers from

# [34, 67, 78]. The list output should not have duplicates.

    for num in arr:
    # Create a list of numbers wanted 
        if num in [34, 67, 78]:
    # Checking if number already # exists before appending

# Unpack a Nest
# For this challenge we need to write a nested loop to access 
# the inner list of the nested list. We then create a new list of
# all the numbers that we need from the list.
