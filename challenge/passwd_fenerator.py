# Password Generator
# Create a function called generate_password that generates any length of password for the user. The password should have a random mix of upper letters, lower letters, numbers, and punctuation symbols. The function should ask the user how strong they want the password to be. The user should pick from - weak, strong, and very strong. If the user picks weak, the function should generate a 5-character long password. If the user picks strong, generate an 8-character password and if they pick very strong, generate a 12-character password.

# string module constants
    a = string.ascii_letters + \
        string.digits + string.punctuation
    password1 =[]
    length = input("Pick your password length "
    "a,b or c: \na. weak \nb.strong \nc." "Very strong...: ")

    if length == 'a': length = 5
    elif length == 'b': length = 8
    elif length == 'c': length = 12
    for i in range(length):
        password = str(random.choice(a)) 
        password1.append(password)
    return 'You password is', ''.join(password1)

# For this challenge, we are using two modules, the string module, and the random module. The string module provides all the characters we need for the password. We use the random module (random.choice) to shuffle variable a. We ask the user to pick the length of the password they want, so after we shuffle the characters of the password, the issued password is the length requested, by the user.
