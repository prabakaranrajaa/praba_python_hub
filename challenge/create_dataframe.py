# Create a DataFrame
# Create a Dataframe using pandas. You are going to create a code to put the following into a Dataframe. You will use the information in the table below. Basically, you are going to recreate this table using pandas. Use the information in the table to recreate the table.


# year	Title	genre
# 2009	Brothers	Drama
# 2002	Spider-Man	Sci-fi
# 2009	WatchMen	Drama
# 2010	Inception	Sci-fi
# 2009	Avatar	Fantasy


import pandas as pd
# Creating a dictionary
table = {'year': [2009, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2009],
'title': ["Brothers", "Spider-Man", "WatchMen", "Inception", "Avatar"],
'genre': ["Drama", "Sci-fi", "Drama", "Sci-fi", "Fantasy"]}

movies = pd.DataFrame(table)

print(movies)



# The first thing that we did was import pandas. Then we put the information in a dictionary. The pd.DataFrame creates a two- dimension table. This is one way you can create a DataFrame using pandas. You may have figured out another way to create it.
