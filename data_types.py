# built in data types of python ...


# Text Type     : 	str

# Sequence Types: 	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type  : 	dict
# Set Types     :   set, frozenset
# Boolean Type  : 	bool
# Binary Types  : 	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
# None Type     :  	NoneType

# You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function.

print(type(5))

# it will print as class 'int'

print(type(3.4))

# it will print as class 'float'

print(type("Python"))

# it will print as class 'str' // that means string ..
# only we give these sentence or lines or letter in double quotation or single quotation for strings.

print(type(2j))

# it will print as class 'complex' ..
# complex value ...


# for list 

a = []

print(type(a))

# it will print as class 'list' becoz of [] these...
# '[]' these are list data types

b = ()

print(type(b))

# it will print as class 'tuple' becoz of () these ...
# '()'  these are tuple data types

c = {}

print(type(c))

# it will print as class 'dict' becoz of {} these ...
# '{}' these are dict data types

# likewise all data types have a built - in - types
